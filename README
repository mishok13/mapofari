What is this?
=============

Mapofari is a map rendering engine in permanent alpha status.
Oh, and it's written in Python.

What this is not?
=================

Mapofari is not a fully-operational rendering engine and doesn't aim to be.
Mapofari will never provide anything besides what I need.
Mapofari is not Mapnik and will never be as good as Mapnik is.
Mapofari is not a project of CloudMade or any other company I've worked or ever going to work in.
Mapofari is also not very performant, though it uses Cairo (which is pretty fast by itself).

What features are already in?
=============================

None.

What is planned?
================

* Support for POI rendering
* Support for line rendering
* Meta-layering support
* Support of Mapnik styles
* Support of MapCSS
* Lots more.
